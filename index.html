                    I've recently switched careers, again, having been a business owner in Richmond
                     for the last 6 years.  Before that, I was a manager for a Parks & Rec 
                     organization in Northern Virginia.  Having sold my business, I am now taking 
                     off on a new adventure: coding.

                    <br><br>I am currently in an intensive program at the University of Richmond 
                    learning full-stack coding.  Once I ace the program, I'll be able to handle 
                    all aspects of web development.  In addition to my quickly-increasing coding 
                    skills, I also have a wealth of business experience, including managing teams 
                    of people, customer service, marketing, facilities management, budgeting and 
                    accounting, and many other executive functions.
                    <br><br>I am married to a wonderful wife, and have three children, ages 13, 9 
                    and 8; they're all girls.  I enjoy outdoor activities such as rock climbing, 
                    backpacking, and skiing, as well as reading and spending time with my family.
